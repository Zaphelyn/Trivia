Trivia Game for Android

Thank you for checking out my trivia app! This package can be imported into Android studio, just download and move into your projects folder or check it out via Github 
inside of the Android Studio IDE. This app began as a sample app for a class that I am currently taking, meant to teach about Android development concepts such as 
lifecycle awareness, material design, pulling and parsing data from an API on the internet, and introduced us to animations. ( Credit to Paulo Dichone and Udemy )
I took it the extra step and made it into an actual game, adding features such as dark mode, a leader board using a recycler view, and a menu to set dark mode and reset the leader board.

This application is free and open-source, just as the tools that I used to make it. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did creating it.

Enjoy! As always, happy coding!
