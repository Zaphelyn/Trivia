Trivia Game for Android

Thank you for checking out my sample trivia app! This package can be imported into Android studio, just download and move into your projects folder or check it out via Github 
inside of the Android Studio IDE. This app began as a sample app for a class that I am currently taking, meant to teach about android development concepts such as 
lifecycle awareness, material design, pulling and parsing data from an API on the internet, and introduced us to animations. ( Credit to Paulo Dichone and Udemy )

This application is free and open-source, just as the tools that I used to make it. My hope is that it may help someone along their path as an Android developer and help 
them to learn some of the same concepts that I have used here.

Enjoy and as always, happy coding!
